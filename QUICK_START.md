## ⚡ Common Questions

### Q: Where do recovered items go?
**A**: They move to "My Recovered Items" (for owners) and "My Returned Items" (for finders). They disappear from the main item list.

### Q: Can I change my rating?
**A**: Currently, ratings are final. This ensures authentic feedback.

### Q: Who can see my reputation?
**A**: Everyone can see it on the leaderboard. It's public to encourage good behavior.

### Q: Do I have to rate immediately?
**A**: No, you can rate later from "My Recovered Items" page.

### Q: What if someone doesn't confirm return?
**A**: Only the owner can confirm. If they don't, the item stays in their list with a "Confirm Return" button.

### Q: Can I export specific date ranges?
**A**: Currently, PDF exports all your recovered items. Date filtering is a future enhancement.
