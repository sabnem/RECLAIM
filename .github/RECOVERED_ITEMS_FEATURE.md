# Recovered Items & Rating System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. **RecoveredItem Model**
Created a new model to track successfully returned items with the following fields:
- `item` - OneToOne link to the Item
- `owner` - User who received the item back
- `finder` - User who returned the item
- `recovered_date` - When the item was recovered
- `original_report_date` - Original date item was reported
- `location` - Where the item was found/returned
- `rating` - 1-5 star rating from owner to finder
- `feedback` - Text feedback from owner
- `rated_at` - When the rating was submitted

### 2. **Updated Item Flow**
- When owner confirms return → Item moves to recovered items
- Recovered items are **excluded** from main item list
- Owner is redirected to rating page after confirming

### 3. **New Pages Created**

#### My Recovered Items (`/my-recovered-items/`)
- Shows items owner got back
- Displays finder information
- Shows ratings given
- Option to rate if not yet rated

#### My Returned Items (`/my-returned-items/`)

- Shows ratings received from owners
- "Awaiting rating" status if not yet rated

#### Rate Finder (`/items/<id>/rate/`)

### 5. **Database Changes**

- Links to rating page

**my_returned_items view:**

- Shows ratings received
- Displays feedback from owners

**rate_finder view:**

- Prevents duplicate ratings

### 7. **Rating System Features**
- ⭐ 1-5 star rating
- Interactive click to rate
- Hover preview effects
- Rating labels:
  - 1 star: "Poor"
  - 2 stars: "Fair"
  - 3 stars: "Good"
  - 4 stars: "Very Good"

## 📋 URLs Added

```python
path('my-recovered-items/', views.my_recovered_items, name='my_recovered_items'),
path('my-returned-items/', views.my_returned_items, name='my_returned_items'),
path('items/<int:item_id>/rate/', views.rate_finder, name='rate_finder'),
```

## 🎨 Templates Created

1. `my_recovered_items.html` - Owner's recovered items page
2. `my_returned_items.html` - Finder's returned items page
3. `rate_finder.html` - Rating submission page

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Finder reports found item**
2. **Finder marks item as returned** → Enters owner's username
3. **Owner confirms return** → Item moved to recovered items
4. **Owner redirected to rating page**
5. **Owner rates finder** (1-5 stars + feedback)
6. **Item appears in:**
   - Owner's "My Recovered Items" ✅
   - Finder's "My Returned Items" ✅
   - NO LONGER in main item list ✅
